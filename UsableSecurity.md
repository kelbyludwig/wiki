## This World of Ours by James Mickens (2012)

* "... when security researchers tell me that they’re not working on passwords, 
it’s like physicists from World War II telling me that they’re not working on
radar or nuclear bombs, but instead they’re unravelling the mystery of how
bumblebees fly. It’s like, you are so close, and yet so far.  You almost get
it, but that’s worse than not getting it at all..."

* "... In the real world, threat models are much simpler (see Figure 1).
  Basically, you’re either dealing with Mossad or not-Mossad. If your adversary
is not-Mossad, then you’ll probably be fine if you pick a good password and
don’t respond to emails from `ChEaPestPAiNPi11s@virus-basket.biz.ru`. If your
adversary is the Mossad, YOU’RE GONNA DIE AND THERE’S NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO
ABOUT IT."

* "My point is that security people need to get their priorities
straight. The “threat model” section of a security paper resembles
the script for a telenovela that was written by a paranoid
schizophrenic..."
